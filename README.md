# Flight-Delay-Prediction.

* Simple ML prediction of fights delayed more than 15 minutes from a singular source namely Seattle.

* Dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.

* Entire Project is done on colab, hence no seperate downloads needed.

* Things to learn:
    * Data Cleaning.
    * Data Preparation.
    * Data Augmentation.
    * Modeling.
        * DecisionTreeRegressor
        * RandomForestRegressor
        * LinearRegression
        * GradientBoostingRegressor
    * Validation
    * Pre-Deployment Requirements.
    * Deployment.
